🎓 Graduation Project Spotlight: Optimizing Research Paper Evaluation

During my graduation project, I led the development of an innovative system aimed at revolutionizing the evaluation process for research papers. This system, meticulously crafted, focuses on streamlining the entire workflow, from submission to evaluation.

🔍 Efficient Scopus Quartile Ranking Integration

One of the core features of our system is its seamless integration with Scopus quartile rankings. Leveraging this data, our system autonomously assesses the quality and impact of research submissions, ensuring a fair and objective evaluation process.

💼 Automated Financial Reward Calculation

In addition to evaluation, our system automates the calculation of financial rewards for accepted submissions. By accurately determining rewards based on predefined criteria, we aim to provide researchers with fair compensation for their contributions.

📧 Prompt Notification System

Time is of the essence in academia. That's why our system is equipped with a prompt email notification feature. Researchers receive timely updates on the status of their submissions, keeping them informed and engaged throughout the process.

⚙️ Enhanced Efficiency for Researchers

Our initiative is driven by a desire to optimize the incentive distribution process. By streamlining evaluation and reward calculation, we aim to alleviate the burden on researchers, allowing them to focus more on their research endeavors.
